# Greenden_project
#I created a responsive Greenden website using HTML and Tailwind CSS.

#It includes a Home page, a Product page, and a Contact page.

#The navbar is available on all pages for easy navigation.

#The website is fully mobile-friendly and adapts to all screen sizes.

#Tailwind CSS is used for fast and clean styling.

#Simple and modern design inspired by plant stores.

#All pages are connected internally with smooth transitions.
